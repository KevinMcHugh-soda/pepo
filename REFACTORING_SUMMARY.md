# Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the major refactoring of the Pepo application's main server code to improve maintainability, testability, and organization.

## Overview

The main refactoring goal was to break down the monolithic `main.go` file into well-organized, single-responsibility packages that follow Go best practices.

## What Changed

### Before Refactoring
- Single 230+ line `main.go` file containing:
  - Configuration loading
  - Database initialization
  - HTTP server setup
  - Route configuration
  - API handler delegation
  - Graceful shutdown logic

### After Refactoring
- Clean 43-line `main.go` that orchestrates components
- Well-organized internal packages with clear responsibilities

## New Package Structure

### `internal/config`
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration management
- `Config` struct with application settings
- Environment variable loading with defaults
- Helper methods like `IsDevelopment()` and `IsProduction()`

### `internal/database`
**Purpose**: Database connection and initialization
- Connection pooling configuration
- Database health checking
- Query initialization
- Graceful connection closing

### `internal/server`
**Purpose**: HTTP server setup and routing
- Server creation and configuration
- Route setup and organization
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Static file serving
- Template rendering

### `internal/middleware`
**Purpose**: HTTP middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Request logging with timing
- Panic recovery
- CORS headers (development mode)
- Security headers
- Middleware chaining utilities

### `internal/handlers/combined.go`
**Purpose**: Consolidated API handler delegation
- Implements all ogen interfaces
- Delegates to specific domain handlers
- Clean separation of API contracts from business logic

## Benefits of the Refactoring

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each package has a single, clear responsibility
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 2. **Better Testability**
- Individual packages can be unit tested in isolation
- Dependency injection makes mocking easier
- Clear interfaces between components

### 3. **Enhanced Reusability**
- Configuration logic can be reused across different commands
- Database initialization can be shared with migration tools
- Middleware can be selectively applied

### 4. **Cleaner Architecture**
- Follows Go project layout conventions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
- Centralized error handling in middleware
- Better error context and logging
- Graceful degradation capabilities

## Code Quality Improvements

### Middleware Stack
The new middleware stack provides:
- **Recovery**: Prevents panics from crashing the server
- **Logging**: Structured request/response logging with timing
- **Security**: Basic security headers for all responses
- **CORS**: Development-friendly CORS handling

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- Type-safe configuration access
- Environment detection helpers

### Database Management
- Proper connection pooling configuration
- Health checking and graceful shutdown
- Separated concerns for easier testing

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. Import paths have changed for internal packages
2. Configuration is now accessed through `config.Config` struct
3. Database initialization returns both `*sql.DB` and `*db.Queries`
4. Server creation is now handled by the `server` package

### For Operations
- No changes to environment variables or deployment
- Same health endpoints and API routes
- Same database connection requirements

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Server
```go
// Simple server start
cfg := config.Load()
db, queries, err := database.Initialize(cfg.DatabaseURL, nil)
// ... error handling
srv, err := server.New(cfg, apiHandler, personHandler, actionHandler)
srv.StartWithGracefulShutdown()
```

### Testing Individual Components
```go
// Test configuration
cfg := &config.Config{Port: "8080", Environment: "test"}

// Test database with custom config
dbConfig := &database.ConnectionConfig{MaxOpenConns: 5}
db, queries, err := database.Initialize(testURL, dbConfig)

// Test server creation
srv, err := server.New(cfg, mockHandler, mockPerson, mockAction)
```

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Metrics**: Add Prometheus metrics middleware
2. **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add request rate limiting middleware
4. **Authentication**: Add JWT or session-based auth middleware
5. **Validation**: Add request validation middleware

### Monitoring Additions
- Health check enhancements with dependency checking
- Readiness and liveness probe endpoints
- Database connection health monitoring

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase's maintainability while preserving all existing functionality. The new structure makes it easier to add features, write tests, and onboard new team members.

The investment in better organization pays dividends in:
- Faster development cycles
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting
- Better code review processes
- Reduced onboarding time for new developers
