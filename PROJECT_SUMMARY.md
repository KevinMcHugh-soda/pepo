## Core Database Model

### Person Table
- **Primary Key**: `id` (BYTEA) - XID stored as 12-byte binary data for optimal storage
- **Name**: `name` (TEXT NOT NULL) - Person's full name with validation
- **Timestamps**: `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Automatic timestamp management
- **Indexes**: Optimized for name searches and chronological sorting
- **Triggers**: Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- **Helper Functions**: `x2b()` and `b2x()` for XID string ↔ bytea conversion

### Action Table
- **Primary Key**: `id` (BYTEA) - XID stored as 12-byte binary data
- **Foreign Key**: `person_id` (BYTEA) - References person(id) with CASCADE delete
- **Occurred At**: `occurred_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When the action happened (defaults to now)
- **Description**: `description` (TEXT NOT NULL) - What the person did
- **References**: `references` (TEXT) - Optional links or references
- **Valence**: `valence` (ENUM) - 'positive' or 'negative' action type
- **Timestamps**: `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Automatic timestamp management
- **Indexes**: Optimized for person_id, occurred_at, and valence queries
- **Constraints**: Description length validation, cascading deletes

## API Implementation

### Endpoints Implemented

#### Person Management
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/persons` - List all persons with pagination
- `POST /api/v1/persons` - Create new person
- `GET /api/v1/persons/{id}` - Get person by XID
- `PUT /api/v1/persons/{id}` - Update person
- `DELETE /api/v1/persons/{id}` - Delete person

#### Action Management
- `GET /api/v1/actions` - List all actions with filtering and pagination
